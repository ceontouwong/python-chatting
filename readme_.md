[2018-10] Lately I'm learning Rust, which interest me much that I going to develop this incompleted project with Rust. But when I will complete it is uncertain, for the spare time is less and less.

# python-chatting
I'm trying to make a chatting application based on flask. What it needs(for now): flask, flask-socketio, jQuery, python

# GOALS
* Verify users' login(For now, the exact method hasn't been decided.)
* Transfer messages using a peer-to-peer network.
* Encrypt sent and received messages.
* Create a simple chatbot.

  ~~Sadly, few things have been done.~~
